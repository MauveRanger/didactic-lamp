A quizzing program written in Java. Runs on terminal only.
It's nothing fancy. It's meant as a study aid. You can write a .quiz file with a text editor, (or not. The filename extension is ignored) and practice facts from European History or whatever. The files are written in my own brand of a language that looks sorta like Python.

It'll have basic adaptive stuff. Like, if you tell it you want to see the question again, it'll show you the question again. Yeah. That kind of thing.

I'm 18, this is one of my first projects, and the code is terrible. You can play around with it if you like, but don't look inside if you're faint of heart.

Licensed under Honor System LGPL. That's where I pretend there's a license here, and you tactfully do not disagree.

Quiz files are UTF-8 encoded text files.
They consist of a series of Context records, separated by newline characters. A Context consists of some number of tab characters followed by a series of other other characters, terminating in a newline. It has rules and stuff. Idk. I'll add that later.

It's getting late. You should probably go to bed.
