A quizzing program written in Java. Interfaces with the terminal.
It's nothing fancy. It's meant as a study aid. You can write a .quiz file with a text editor, (or not. The file ending is ignored) and practice facts from European History or whatever.

It has basic adaptive stuff. Like, if you tell it you want to see the question again, it'll show you the question again. Yeah.
